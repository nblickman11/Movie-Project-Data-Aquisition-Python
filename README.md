# Movie-Project-Data-Aquisition-Python


In Data Acquisition Movie Project/Increasing Granularity of the Data, there are 3 folders (Awards, Plots, and Taglines).
At a very high level, each folder performs a similar analysis.  When you first click into one of those 3 folders, the first
file you should open is the "main code" file, as that begins the data acquisition process.

An analysis includes looping through hundreds of urls on the web, using Beautiful Soup in Python to then pull raw data from all of these url links, 
and then clean/organize the raw data and export it into another notebook with the json library.  The code is very well commented.
